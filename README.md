<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

Hi üëã, I'm Kelvin, a third-year computer engineering student at the University of British Columbia with a passion for software development and an eye for innovation. 
My experience includes a Software Developer Internship at ARIS Environmental, where I contributed to enhancing system reliability, streamlining communication, and deploying cloud services efficiently. I spearheaded automated testing procedures, advocated for Docker-based deployments, and overhauled build processes to solve complex challenges.

My technical strengths lie in TypeScript, React, and Python, and I thrive when designing and implementing end-to-end web-based solutions. Whether it's spearheading automated testing procedures to boost uptime, advocating for Docker-based deployments, or overhauling build processes, I'm dedicated to solving complex challenges.

I'm on a mission to secure a full-stack development role, leveraging my experience in building applications from start to finish and my ability to collaborate effectively in teams. Let's connect and explore opportunities to create innovative solutions together!

  ## Personal Projects

  ### üîí [3FA](https://github.com/Computing-Collective/3FA)
  In the 3FA project, I assumed a pivotal role in both constructing a comprehensive backend API using Python, employing Flask and SQLite as well as developing a web app and an electron app. This undertaking encompassed the development of over 20 endpoints, each tailored to facilitate distinct functionalities. Additionally, I took charge of the design and implementation of a robust authentication flow, meticulously aligning with OWASP security standards. This involved the establishment of secure session and authentication tokens, encrypted communication channels, password hashing, and the inclusion of automatic timeouts to fortify our security measures. Simultaneously, on the frontend, I harnessed my expertise to craft over 15 bespoke React components. These components not only expedited development by 30%, but they also orchestrated a harmonious and user-centric experience across the entire application. I was also tasked with integrating hardware and backend components into the frontend within a tight 1-week window. 

  ### üìÜ [Notion Canvas Sync / Canvas Instructure & Notion Plugin](https://github.com/im-calvin/calendar)
  The Notion Canvas Sync Plugin is a project that I developed to simplify my life as a student at UBC. As someone who is heavily reliant on Notion for keeping track of assignments, deadlines, and other important information, I found myself frustrated with the tedious task of manually inserting entries into my calendar. This plugin integrates seamlessly with Canvas, UBC's school portal, and automatically updates my Notion calendar with all the relevant information. Since I shared it with my friends, it has been used by 15 people and has helped them tremendously in organizing their academic lives. In the future, I plan to expand the functionality of this plugin and integrate it with other tools that students use on a regular basis. 

  ### :electron: [Musictag](https://github.com/im-calvin/musictag)
  Musictag is a project that was inspired by my personal frustration with manually modifying the metadata of cover songs downloaded from [YouTube](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl). To solve this problem, I developed an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app that streamlines the process of editing music metadata. Throughout the development of this project, I gained a deep understanding of the full development life cycle of a product, from ideation to deployment. Currently, Musictag is only capable of serving songs from the [Holodex API](https://holodex.stoplight.io/), but I plan to expand its capabilities to include other libraries like [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) so that it can serve an even larger variety of songs. With the help of [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/), I'm able to publish updates to users and package the app for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
  
<!-- Hackathons --> 

  ## üê±‚Äçüíª Hackathons

  ### üéÆ [Japango]([https://github.com/bxi](https://github.com/bxian03/StormHacks2023/)
  JapanGo is a multiplayer, web-based game designed to help people become familiar with the Japanese alphabets in a fun and competitive way. Inspired by [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/), users are able to create a room, share the code and then race to see who can decipher the question first. It was created during [Stormhacks 2023](https://stormhacks.com/), an in-person 24 hour hackathon. Using websockets and Firebase, we were able to create a real-time connection between different clients with minimal latency, removing technical issues so that users could focus on memorizing their alphabets. Other technologies that we used include React and Tailwind for the frontend, and Python with FastAPI in the backend.  
  
  ### ‚úçÔ∏è [TODO: Tasks, Objectives, and Discussions Organized (NWHacks 2023)](https://github.com/Computing-Collective/TODO)
  Frustrated by the abundance of services that we had to use to access course information and assignments, we created a web-app with React to combine our Canvas, Piazza (and more in the future) assignments, messages, and Q&A posts all into one location. With [others](https://github.com/TODO-nwHacks-2023), we created a Python back end that interacts with the [Canvas API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/) as well as an [unofficial Piazza API](https://github.com/hfaran/piazza-api). The back end also syncs data with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database for storing and retrieving information. Lastly, we had a React [front end](/frontend) that communicates with our custom [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) API to retrieve and display the information to users. I was primarily responsible for the front end, but also contributed to the back end through data collection and wrangling with the APIs.
  
  ### üéµ [SpotifyGo](https://github.com/kputhanangadi/SpotifyGo)
  SpotifyGo is a project born out of the desire to make daily commutes more enjoyable by providing a custom playlist tailored to the exact length of the commute. The project uses the Spotify API to generate a playlist based on the user's preferences and the estimated length of the commute. I was responsible for creating the back end API using Express.js and implementing the front end using React. To make the user experience smoother, I spearheaded the integrated of the Google Maps Matrix API, allowing users to select their location with autofill. This project helped me develop my skills in API integration, front-end development, and project management.
  
  ### üß™ [Organic Chemistry Quiz Discord Bot](https://github.com/im-calvin/HackToSchoolBot22) [(Hack To School 2022 Hackathon First Overall)](https://github.com/bxian03/HackToSchoolAPI22)
  The Organic Chemistry Quiz Discord Bot was aimed to make learning compound names more fun and engaging. We created a Discord bot that quizzes users on compound names and awards points for correct answers. Participating in my first hackathon was an amazing learning experience where I honed my skills in pair programming, time-management, and effective communication

  ### üêà [Mittens Bot](https://github.com/im-calvin/Mittens)
 Mittens is a project that I started as a complete beginner in programming, and she remains one of my most cherished projects. Initially, she was meant to help communicate with Japanese speaking users in a small Discord channel by translating every message. However, it soon grew to include other features like notifying users when Hololive streamers scheduled streams or went live. Over time, I added more functionality, such as translating Japanese kanji to furigana, pulling lyrics for karaoke tracks, and notifying for Twitter alerts. It is now up and running on Heroku without any issue. Through this project, I learned about web scraping, asynchronous functions, APIs, and more. Despite its humble beginnings, Mittens has become an important part of my programming journey. One day, I hope to refactor her with my newfound knowledge and smile at the workarounds that I had to make in my infancy as a programmer.

  ### üíª [Personal Website](https://kelvinw.com)
  This is my personal portfolio website , custom built using React, Astro, and TailwindCSS. It showcases my skills and projects, and provides a way for potential clients and collaborators to get in touch with me. It is currently deployed using Firebase at [kelvinw.com](https://kelvinw.com) and [Github Pages](https://im-calvin.github.io).
