  ## :school: UBC Course Projects
  *Code access is available upon request for all projects
  #### [Multi-Client Server](https://cpen221-ubc.notion.site/Message-Queues-Pub-Sub-with-Twitter-c5965b28ed01482aad44dbaadac19b77) - CPEN 221
  - Constructed a server supporting multiple simultaneous clients capable of interacting and fetching tweets from Twitter
  - Enabled dual-server routing so that either server can be connected to, and no interruptions occur if one goes offline
  - Followed security protocols by hashing and salting all passwords and encrypting incoming and outgoing data via AES
  
  #### Simple RISC Machine - CPEN 211
  - Designed a Turing Complete 16-bit RISC Machine using System Verilog on an FPGA board in 3 weeks
  - Subdivided the machine into smaller modules to be designed, tested, and debugged more easily
  - Developed testbenches through ModelSim to thoroughly test system designs
  - Achieved a 300% improvement in operations per cycle through the use of pipelining, exceeding course expectiations
  
  #### [Graphs, Games, and Interplanetary Travel](https://cpen221-ubc.notion.site/Graphs-Games-and-Interplanetary-Travel-79cb9a0844634b7288226639604eb0b0) - CPEN 221
  - Collaboratively built the ‚ÄúKamino Game‚Äù in Java and built an algorithm to traverse the game to collect points.
  - Implemented graph and tree data structures with associated algorithms while optimizing time and space complexity
  - Exercised best practices including unit testing, documentation, and encapsulation to ensure quality and correctness
  
  ## Personal Projects
  
  ### :electron: [Musictag](https://github.com/im-calvin/musictag)
  Musictag is a project that was inspired by my personal frustration with manually modifying the metadata of cover songs downloaded from [YouTube](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl). To solve this problem, I developed an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app that streamlines the process of editing music metadata. Throughout the development of this project, I gained a deep understanding of the full development life cycle of a product, from ideation to deployment. Currently, Musictag is only capable of serving songs from the [Holodex API](https://holodex.stoplight.io/), but I plan to expand its capabilities to include other libraries like [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) so that it can serve an even larger variety of songs. With the help of [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/), I'm able to publish updates to users and package the app for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
  
  ### üêà [Mittens Bot](https://github.com/im-calvin/mittens_bot)
 Mittens is a project that I started as a complete beginner in programming, and she remains one of my most cherished projects. Initially, she was meant to help communicate with Japanese speaking users in a small Discord channel by translating every message. However, it soon grew to include other features like notifying users when Hololive streamers scheduled streams or went live. Over time, I added more functionality, such as translating Japanese kanji to furigana, pulling lyrics for karaoke tracks, and notifying for Twitter alerts. It is now up and running on Heroku without any issue. Through this project, I learned about web scraping, asynchronous functions, APIs, and more. Despite its humble beginnings, Mittens has become an important part of my programming journey. One day, I hope to refactor her with my newfound knowledge and smile at the workarounds that I had to make in my infancy as a programmer.

  
<!-- Hackathons --> 

  ## üê±‚Äçüíª Hackathons
  
  ### ‚úçÔ∏è [TODO: Tasks, Objectives, and Discussions Organized (NWHacks 2023)](https://github.com/TODO-nwHacks-2023/TODO)
  Frustrated by the abundance of services that we had to use to access course information and assignments, we created a web-app with React to combine our Canvas, Piazza (and more in the future) assignments, messages, and Q&A posts all into one location. With [others](https://github.com/TODO-nwHacks-2023), we created a Python back end that interacts with the [Canvas API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/) as well as an [unofficial Piazza API](https://github.com/hfaran/piazza-api). The back end also syncs data with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database for storing and retrieving information. Lastly, we had a React [front end](/frontend) that communicates with our custom [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) API to retrieve and display the information to users. I was primarily responsible for the front end, but also contributed to the back end through data collection and wrangling with the APIs.
  
  ### üéµ [SpotifyGo](https://github.com/kputhanangadi/SpotifyGo)
  SpotifyGo is a project born out of the desire to make daily commutes more enjoyable by providing a custom playlist tailored to the exact length of the commute. The project uses the Spotify API to generate a playlist based on the user's preferences and the estimated length of the commute. I was responsible for creating the back end API using Express.js and implementing the front end using React. To make the user experience smoother, I spearheaded the integrated of the Google Maps Matrix API, allowing users to select their location with autofill. This project helped me develop my skills in API integration, front-end development, and project management.
  
  ### üß™ [Organic Chemistry Quiz Discord Bot](https://github.com/im-calvin/HackToSchoolBot22) [(Hack To School 2022 Hackathon First Overall)](https://github.com/bxian03/HackToSchoolAPI22)
  The Organic Chemistry Quiz Discord Bot was aimed to make learning compound names more fun and engaging. We created a Discord bot that quizzes users on compound names and awards points for correct answers. Participating in my first hackathon was an amazing learning experience where I honed my skills in pair programming, time-management, and effective communication

  ### üìÜ [Notion Canvas Sync / Canvas Instructure & Notion Plugin](https://github.com/im-calvin/calendar)
  The Notion Canvas Sync Plugin is a project that I developed to simplify my life as a student at UBC. As someone who is heavily reliant on Notion for keeping track of assignments, deadlines, and other important information, I found myself frustrated with the tedious task of manually inserting entries into my calendar. This plugin integrates seamlessly with Canvas, UBC's school portal, and automatically updates my Notion calendar with all the relevant information. Since I shared it with my friends, it has been used by 15 people and has helped them tremendously in organizing their academic lives. In the future, I plan to expand the functionality of this plugin and integrate it with other tools that students use on a regular basis. 
  
  ### üíª [Personal Website](https://github.com/im-calvin.github.io)
  I'm also developing my own personal website using React. This is a long-term project that I revisit whenever I don't have to work on something urgent. I'm taking my time to create something truly custom that showcases my skills and passions. While this project is currently on the back burner, it's been an excellent opportunity for me to learn and grow as a frontend web developer. I look forward to sharing it with everyone when it's ready.
